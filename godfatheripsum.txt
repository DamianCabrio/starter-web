Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm alive.

Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.

You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? It's not personal. It's business. Te salut, Don Corleone. Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men.
